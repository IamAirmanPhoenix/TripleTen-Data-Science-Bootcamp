# Sprint 11: Linear Algebra
This sprint covers topics focused in understanding the way some machine learning algorithms uses vectors and arrays to generate classification and regression models.

## Sprint contents
* Vectors and vector operations.
* Distance between vectors (euclidean, manhattan and kNN).
* Matrix operations.
* Linear regression model explained.
* Objective function.
* Linear regression model using linear algebra.

## Files
* Notebook with the project development.
* Folder with the dataset used.
