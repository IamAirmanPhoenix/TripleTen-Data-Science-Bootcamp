# Sprint 5: Software development tools
This repository is used to present my Sprint 5 project of the DS bootcamp.

In this repository I scripted a python application to plot histograms and scatter diagrams depending of the column(s) selected on each point.
I used the Streamlit module to plot all the images and also made a pre-processing of the data to fit my requirements. I hope ir is of your
liking.
